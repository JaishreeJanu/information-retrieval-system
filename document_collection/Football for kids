As we learn more about the long-term effects of concussions, parents are becoming more hesitant to let their children play football. 

To improve the safety of players and keep kids playing the sport, USA Football has created Heads Up Football, a program that teaches everything from proper equipment fitting to better tackling techniques. However, reviews of the program are decidedly mixed.

Overall, the information on USA Football's website is a step in the right direction. The program's goal is to establish certified coaches who will be able to perform its four pillars correctly: equipment fitting, concussion awareness, heat and hydration, and heads up tackling. 
Program Effectiveness

There isn't a parent out there who would argue against having their kids' coaches more knowledgeable about the four pillars, but the program's effectiveness is called into question because the certification can be obtained online in 90 minutes and it isn't even a requirement.

All coaches should receive training on how to keep players safe, and, particularly in football, be aware of the symptoms of concussions. While you can't fault the NFL—which helps fund Heads Up—for doing something to get the information out there and make the game safer, the program's purpose appears to be damage control due to the discovery of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), "...a progressive degenerative disease which affects the brain of people who have suffered repeated concussions," which can result in memory loss, depression, poor impulse control and dementia. 
Heads Up Tackling

In the 2015 offseason, San Francisco 49ers linebacker Chris Borland retired after his first year in the NFL.
